# Voltix: High-Frequency Trading Simulation Platform

Voltix is a cutting-edge Distributed High-Frequency Trading (HFT) simulation platform that leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to analyze market dynamics, agent interactions, and volatility. This platform is designed for financial market researchers and developers to explore advanced trading strategies and market behaviors.

## **Current Progress**

### **Core Features Implemented**
1. **Custom Environment Setup**:
   - Developed a simulation environment to mimic a realistic financial market.
   - Integrated a **Limit Order Book (LOB)** model with nanosecond-level precision.
   - Configured a market simulation kernel for agent-based interactions, including trading agent decision-making and latency optimization.
   - Incorporated **historical NASDAQ LOB data** for realistic agent behavior, with preprocessing for compatibility.
   - Established metrics to validate market realism, including order flow, volume patterns, and price impact analysis.

2. **Market Dynamics**:
   - Simulated key market factors:
     - **Liquidity constraints**.
     - **Dynamic volatility**.
     - **Market depth**.
   - Implemented order types such as market orders, limit orders, and cancellations.
   - Developed latency modeling to reflect the impact of timing on trading decisions.

3. **Agent Behavior**:
   - Configured agent behaviors to reflect historical patterns, focusing on competitive and cooperative strategies.
   - Initialized agents for interaction and testing under real-world-like conditions.

## **Next Steps**

### **Immediate Goals**
1. **Refine the Market Simulation**:
   - Enhance the realism of the LOB model by improving liquidity and volatility adjustments.
   - Fine-tune metrics to ensure simulation outputs align closely with historical data.

2. **Encapsulate Environment in Gymnasium**:
   - Create a Gymnasium-compatible API for seamless MARL integration.
   - Define state, action, and reward spaces tailored for HFT activities.

3. **Visualization and Analytics**:
   - Visualize market data, including price trends and order book depth.
   - Develop real-time dashboards for performance monitoring and agent behavior analysis.

4. **Agent Development**:
   - Implement basic RL agents using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN).
   - Compare cooperative vs. competitive strategies to evaluate market impact.
